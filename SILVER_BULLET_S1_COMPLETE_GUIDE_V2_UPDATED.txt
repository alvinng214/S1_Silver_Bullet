================================================================================
1. STRATEGY OVERVIEW
================================================================================

Strategy S1: Silver Bullet is a time-based ICT strategy that executes during 
specific killzone windows after a liquidity sweep and market structure shift.

CORE REQUIREMENTS:
- Time Filter: Active killzone (London or NY)
- Liquidity Target: Day high/low, session high/low, equal highs/lows
- Sweep: Wick beyond liquidity, close back inside
- MSS/CHOCH: Candle CLOSE beyond last internal swing (not wick-only)
- FVG: Formed DURING the MSS displacement leg
- Entry: At FVG boundary or CE midpoint

SILVER BULLET WINDOWS (NY Time):
- London: 3:00 AM - 4:00 AM
- NY AM: 10:00 AM - 11:00 AM
- NY PM: 2:00 PM - 3:00 PM

================================================================================
2. PHASE 1: HIGHER TIMEFRAME BIAS DETERMINATION
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 1: Determine HTF Market Structure Trend (Daily/4H)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OBJECTIVE:
Establish directional bias — bullish (HH/HL) or bearish (LH/LL). 
This gates ALL trades. Trade ONLY in direction of HTF structure.

PRIMARY SCRIPT: Market_Structure_MTF_Trend__Pt_.txt

WHY THIS SCRIPT:
- Pivot-based CHoCH/BOS using candle CLOSES (not wicks)
- Tracks 4 timeframes simultaneously
- Distinguishes trend reversal (CHoCH) from continuation (BOS)
- Clear visual distinction between structure states
- Alerts on structure change

CONFIGURATION:
- TF1 = 15m (entry timeframe)
- TF2 = 1H (intermediate)
- TF3 = 4H (HTF bias)
- TF4 = Daily (macro bias)

ALTERNATIVE PRIMARY: Smart_Money_Concept__TradingFinder__Major_Minor_OB___FVG__SMC_.txt

WHY THIS SCRIPT:
- Major vs Minor structure distinction
- CHoCH vs BOS lines with visualization
- Shows which structure breaks are significant (Major) vs internal (Minor)
- Combined with OB detection for efficiency

SECONDARY SCRIPT: CandelaCharts - HTF Sweeps.txt

WHY THIS SCRIPT:
- Displays actual 4H/Daily/Weekly candles on your LTF chart
- See HTF candle color and direction without switching timeframes
- Visual confirmation of HTF trend at a glance

DECISION RULE:
- TF3 (4H) and TF4 (Daily) same direction = confirmed bias
- Recent BOS on 4H in direction of Daily = high probability
- CHoCH on 4H against Daily = potential reversal, wait for confirmation
- Major structure break > Minor structure break in significance

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 2: Identify HTF Points of Interest (POI)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OBJECTIVE:
Mark unmitigated HTF Order Blocks and Fair Value Gaps where institutional 
orders likely rest. S1 requires price to be AT or approaching a HTF POI.

PRIMARY SCRIPT: MirPapa-ICT-HTF-_FVG_OB_Threeple__EN_.txt

WHY THIS SCRIPT:
- Auto-detects HTF POIs on your LTF chart
- Shows HighTF, MidTF, and CurrentTF zones simultaneously
- Detects FOB (FVG + OB overlap) — highest confluence zones
- Color-coded by timeframe for easy identification
- No need to switch charts
- Implements ICT "Threeple" concept (same zone on 3 TFs = high probability)

AUTO TIMEFRAME MAPPING:
- 1m chart  → Mid: 5m,  High: 15m
- 5m chart  → Mid: 15m, High: 1H
- 15m chart → Mid: 1H,  High: 4H
- 1H chart  → Mid: 4H,  High: Daily
- 4H chart  → Mid: Daily, High: Weekly

ALTERNATIVE PRIMARY: Smart_Money_Concept__TradingFinder__Major_Minor_OB___FVG__SMC_.txt

WHY THIS SCRIPT:
- Major vs Minor Order Blocks (significance ranking)
- CHoCH vs BOS origin (reversal vs continuation OBs)
- OB Refinement (Aggressive/Defensive entry zones)
- Combined with structure detection

SECONDARY SCRIPT: Smart_Money_Zones__FVG___OB____MTF_Trend_Panel.txt

WHY THIS SCRIPT:
- ATR-based strength classification (WEAK to VERY STRONG)
- Separate FVG and OB detection
- Mitigation tracking at 50% fill
- Use when you want strength ratings for individual zones

WHEN TO USE WHICH:
- MirPapa = When you want Threeple (zone across 3 TFs)
- SMC Major/Minor = When you want OB significance ranking
- Smart Money Zones = When you want zone strength ratings

DECISION RULE:
- No POI nearby = no trade
- Threeple zone (appears on 3 TFs) = highest probability
- Major OB from CHoCH origin > Minor OB from BOS origin
- STRONG or VERY STRONG zones preferred

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 3: Identify External Liquidity Targets (Draw on Liquidity)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OBJECTIVE:
Determine where price is heading — the untaken liquidity that acts as a magnet.
This determines your PROFIT TARGET and helps confirm trade direction.

PRIMARY SCRIPT: CandelaCharts - HTF Sweeps.txt

WHY THIS SCRIPT:
- Shows highs/lows of 4H, Daily, Weekly candles as layered liquidity targets
- Each HTF candle extreme is a potential draw
- Visual representation of liquidity structure across timeframes
- Sweep detection on these levels (covered in Step 6)

ALTERNATIVE PRIMARY: Smart_Money_Concept__TradingFinder__Major_Minor_OB___FVG__SMC_.txt

WHY THIS SCRIPT:
- Static Liquidity Lines (larger pivot-based)
- Dynamic Liquidity Lines (smaller pivot-based)
- Two-tier liquidity system

SECONDARY SCRIPT: Liquidity & inducements.txt

WHY THIS SCRIPT:
- Marks buyside (BSL) and sellside (SSL) liquidity at swing pivots
- Detects equal highs/lows where stops cluster
- Updates as levels are swept
- Multiple liquidity types: Grabs, Sweeps, Turtle Soups

DECISION RULE:
- Bullish bias → target nearest untaken BSL (HTF high, equal highs)
- Bearish bias → target nearest untaken SSL (HTF low, equal lows)
- Multiple untaken levels = scale-out targets

================================================================================
3. PHASE 2: SESSION PREPARATION
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 4: Mark Current Session Levels (Liquidity for Sweep)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OBJECTIVE:
Identify session highs/lows that must be SWEPT before entry setup forms.
These are the liquidity pools that institutions target.

PRIMARY SCRIPT: SW's AsiaLondon HL's.txt

WHY THIS SCRIPT:
- Automatic session detection: Asia (5pm-2am), London (12am-9am), NY (5:30am-2pm)
- Tracks PDH/PDL (Previous Day High/Low)
- Levels update live during session, freeze when session ends
- Clean labels for each level
- Includes session midpoint

SECONDARY SCRIPT: ICT_Customizable_50__Line___DailyAsiaLondonNew_York_HighLow___True_Day_Open.txt

WHY THIS SCRIPT:
- 50% line divides premium/discount zones (critical for S1)
- True Day Open (5pm NY time)
- Killzone visualization with session boundaries
- Confluence checklist for manual tracking

OPTIONAL: Ighodalo_Gold_-_CRT__Candles_are_ranges_theory_.txt

WHY THIS SCRIPT:
- Treats HTF candles as ranges (alternative approach)
- Track 4 different timeframe ranges simultaneously
- Midpoint (50%) tracking within ranges
- Useful for seeing session candle as range box

DECISION RULE:
- Before London: Mark Asia H/L as sweep targets
- Before NY: Mark Asia + London H/L as sweep targets
- PDH/PDL are always major targets
- Entry in discount (below 50%) for longs, premium (above 50%) for shorts

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 5: Confirm Active Killzone Window
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OBJECTIVE:
Verify you're in a valid Silver Bullet trading window.
Outside killzone = NO TRADE.

PRIMARY SCRIPT: ICT_Silver_Bullet_with_signals.txt  ** NEW PRIMARY **

WHY THIS SCRIPT:
- All three Silver Bullet windows (3-4 AM, 10-11 AM, 2-3 PM)
- PRE-SESSION PERIODS (30 min before each window) for setup preparation
- Session-aware FVG filtering
- Built-in MSS detection (Step 7)
- FVG Retrace alerts = ENTRY SIGNALS (Step 9)
- Auto target generation (Step 11)
- Minimum Trade Framework calculation
- MOST COMPLETE Silver Bullet implementation

PRE-SESSION PERIODS:
- 2:30-3:00 AM (before London SB)
- 9:30-10:00 AM (before NY AM SB)
- 1:30-2:00 PM (before NY PM SB)

SECONDARY SCRIPT: ICT_Silver_Bullet__LuxAlgo___shorttitle__LuxAlgo_-_ICT_Silver_Bullet.txt

WHY THIS SCRIPT:
- Four FVG strictness modes (All → Super-Strict)
- Clean session visualization
- Use if you prefer visual-only without signals

TERTIARY SCRIPT: Silver_Bullet_ICT_Strategy__TradingFinder__10-11_AM_NY_Time__FVG_TFlab_Silver_Bullet.txt

WHY THIS SCRIPT:
- Specifically designed for 10-11 AM NY Silver Bullet
- Defines 9-10 AM as "Opening Range" and 10-11 AM as "Trading Window"
- More explicit logic for NY AM session specifically

DECISION RULE:
- Session label visible = valid window
- Pre-session active = prepare for setup
- No label = wait or no trade
- Trade only within marked session boundaries

================================================================================
4. PHASE 3: SETUP IDENTIFICATION
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 6: Wait for Liquidity Sweep
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OBJECTIVE:
Price must sweep liquidity in the OPPOSITE direction of intended trade.
Sweep = wick beyond level, then CLOSE back inside (raid, not breakout).

For Silver Bullet, prioritize sweeps of TRADABLE liquidity pools:
- Asia / London / NY session highs & lows
- PDH / PDL (previous day high/low)
- Equal highs / equal lows (stop pools)

PRIMARY SCRIPTS:
1) Liquidity & inducements.txt
2) SW's AsiaLondon HL's.txt

WHY THESE SCRIPTS:
- They plot the exact liquidity pools S1 actually trades (session extremes + inducement/pools)
- Keeps sweep detection tied to PD arrays and session logic, not generic HTF candle extremes
- Reduces noise: you are sweeping a known pool, not “any HTF wick”

SUPPORTING SCRIPT (HTF context / overlay):
- CandelaCharts - HTF Sweeps.txt
  - Use to validate HTF raids and broader context
  - NOT the primary trigger for S1 (too HTF-candle-centric for LTF execution)

OPTIONAL:
- Ighodalo Gold - CRT (Candles are ranges theory).txt
  - Turtle Soup style sweep/return signals
  - Use only as confirmation (do not replace the S1 sequence with CRT signals)

DECISION RULE:
- Bullish S1: require sell-side raid (SSL) → sweep session low / PDL / equal lows, then close back inside.
- Bearish S1: require buy-side raid (BSL) → sweep session high / PDH / equal highs, then close back inside.
- Sweep must occur INSIDE killzone AND before MSS.
- Invalidation: body accepts beyond the level (close outside) or the sweep extreme is taken again after MSS → stand down.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


STEP 7: Confirm Market Structure Shift (MSS/CHOCH)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OBJECTIVE:
After sweep, price must break structure in the OPPOSITE direction.
MSS = candle CLOSE beyond last internal swing (not wick-only).

PRIMARY SCRIPT: ICT_Silver_Bullet_with_signals.txt  ** NEW PRIMARY **

WHY THIS SCRIPT:
- BUILT-IN MSS DETECTION combined with session timing
- MSS triggers on close > last swing high (bullish) or close < last swing low (bearish)
- Already integrated with FVG detection
- Single script covers Steps 5, 7, 8, 9

MSS LOGIC (from script lines 214-219):
- Bullish MSS: close > aZZ.y.get(iH) where iH is last swing high
- Bearish MSS: close < aZZ.y.get(iL) where iL is last swing low

SECONDARY SCRIPT: Market_Structure_MTF_Trend__Pt_.txt

WHY THIS SCRIPT:
- Uses candle CLOSES not wicks — matches S1 specification exactly
- Pivot-based swing detection (not body-based approximation)
- Clear visual distinction between CHoCH (reversal) and BOS (continuation)
- Alerts on structure change
- Multi-TF capability

ALTERNATIVE: Smart_Money_Concept__TradingFinder__Major_Minor_OB___FVG__SMC_.txt

WHY THIS SCRIPT:
- Major vs Minor CHoCH distinction
- Visual CHoCH/BOS lines
- Shows significance of structure break

TERTIARY SCRIPT: cd_sweep&cisd_Cx.txt

WHY THIS SCRIPT:
- CISD (Change in State of Delivery) triggers after range break
- Looks for first opposite-color body candle
- Draws CISD level line
- Approximates MSS concept (use as a proxy / secondary confirmation)
- Also includes SMT divergence tooling (see Step 12)

HOW TO USE (CISD as Step 7 filter):
- Only consider CISD AFTER a confirmed sweep (Step 6)
- Require a candle BODY CLOSE beyond the CISD level in trade direction
- Treat CISD as secondary confirmation; primary MSS remains the close beyond the last swing level

OPTIONAL (time-specific bundle):
- Silver Bullet ICT Strategy [TradingFinder] 10-11 AM NY Time +FVG,TFlab Silver Bullet.txt
  - Narrow 10–11 AM NY Silver Bullet tooling; use if you want hard-coded timing/labels.

DECISION RULE:
- Bullish S1 (after SSL sweep): CHoCH = close ABOVE last swing high
- Bearish S1 (after BSL sweep): CHoCH = close BELOW last swing low
- Structure shift must occur AFTER the sweep, not before
- No MSS after sweep = no trade

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 8: Identify FVG Formed During MSS Displacement Leg
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OBJECTIVE:
Locate FVG that formed DURING the MSS candle(s) — not just any FVG in session.
This is your entry zone.

PRIMARY SCRIPT: ICT_Silver_Bullet_with_signals.txt  ** NEW PRIMARY **

WHY THIS SCRIPT:
- FVG detection integrated with MSS detection
- Session-filtered (only shows FVGs in SB windows)
- HTF FVG option (1, 3, 5, 10, 15 min candles)
- Trend-filtered FVGs (only direction-aligned)
- Auto-removes broken FVGs
- ALERTS: "Bull FVG Formed", "Bear FVG Formed"

SECONDARY SCRIPT: ICT_Silver_Bullet__LuxAlgo___shorttitle__LuxAlgo_-_ICT_Silver_Bullet.txt

WHY THIS SCRIPT:
- Four strictness modes:
  * "All FVG" — every gap
  * "Only FVG in same direction of trend" — trend-aligned only
  * "Strict" — requires retrace AND close confirmation
  * "Super-Strict" — requires retrace, close in direction, zone hold
- FVG boxes extend until invalidated
- Clean visualization

TERTIARY SCRIPT: Smart_Money_Zones__FVG___OB____MTF_Trend_Panel.txt

WHY THIS SCRIPT:
- ATR-based strength classification (WEAK to VERY STRONG)
- Impulse body requirement filters quality
- Mitigation tracking shows if FVG partially filled
- Strength rating helps prioritize which FVG to trade


OPTIONAL FILTER SCRIPT: ICT Balanced Price Range [TradingFinder]  BPR  FVG + IFVG.txt

WHY THIS SCRIPT (BPR / IFVG):
- BPR (Balanced Price Range) highlights overlapping imbalances that often act as a cleaner POI than a single FVG
- IFVG (Inversion FVG) flags when an FVG FAILS and flips; helps you avoid bidding/offering a dead gap

HOW TO APPLY TO S1:
- Prefer an MSS-leg FVG that also sits inside a BPR overlap (higher-quality entry zone)
- If your chosen FVG becomes an IFVG (price closes through and flips), treat it as setup INVALIDATION for classic S1

DECISION RULE:
- FVG must be in direction of new trend (bullish FVG after bullish MSS)
- FVG must form during or immediately after the MSS displacement candle
- Prefer STRONG or VERY STRONG FVGs
- Multiple FVGs = choose one closest to current price or with best strength

================================================================================
5. PHASE 4: ENTRY & TRADE MANAGEMENT
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 9: Entry at FVG Zone
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OBJECTIVE:
Place limit order at FVG boundary or consequent encroachment (CE/midpoint).

PRIMARY SCRIPT: ICT_Silver_Bullet_with_signals.txt  ** NEW PRIMARY **

WHY THIS SCRIPT:
- FVG RETRACE ALERT = ENTRY SIGNAL
- "Bull FVG Retrace" / "Bear FVG Retrace" alerts when price enters FVG
- Minimum Trade Framework shows minimum acceptable target
- Auto-draws target lines from FVG to pivot levels

ENTRY SIGNAL LOGIC (from script):
- Bull entry: low < fvg.box.get_top() (price enters bullish FVG from above)
- Bear entry: high > fvg.box.get_bottom() (price enters bearish FVG from below)

SECONDARY SCRIPT: ICT_Silver_Bullet__LuxAlgo___shorttitle__LuxAlgo_-_ICT_Silver_Bullet.txt

WHY THIS SCRIPT:
- Clear FVG boxes showing entry zone boundaries
- Box top = proximal for bullish FVG
- Box bottom = proximal for bearish FVG
- Visual reference for limit order placement

TERTIARY SCRIPT: ICT_Setup_01__TradingFinder__FVG___Liquidity_SweepsHunt_Alerts__ICT_Setup_01_TFlab.txt

WHY THIS SCRIPT:
- "Discount & Premium" toggle refines FVG to optimal portion
- Discount portion for longs, premium portion for shorts
- Multiple reaction tracking for zone tests

OPTIONAL: Fibonacci_Optimal_Entry_Zone__OTE___Zeiierman_.txt

WHY THIS SCRIPT:
- 61.8%-78.6% Fibonacci retracement zone (OTE)
- If FVG aligns with OTE = highest confluence entry
- Additional confirmation layer

DECISION RULE:
- Conservative: Enter at FVG proximal edge (top for bullish, bottom for bearish)
- Aggressive: Enter at FVG CE (50% of gap)
- Best: FVG overlapping with OTE zone
- Use limit orders, not market orders
- FVG Retrace alert = confirmation to place order
- Optional: Prefer FVG that overlaps a BPR (Balanced Price Range) zone
- Optional: If FVG inverts into IFVG before entry/after touch (close through + flip), cancel classic S1 entry
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 10: Stop Loss Placement
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OBJECTIVE:
Place stop beyond sweep extreme OR beyond the MSS swing.

PRIMARY SCRIPT: CandelaCharts - HTF Sweeps.txt

WHY THIS SCRIPT:
- Shows exact price level of the sweep
- Stop goes beyond this level
- Sweep line provides precise reference
- Validated sweep level is your invalidation point

SECONDARY SCRIPT: Liquidity & inducements.txt

WHY THIS SCRIPT:
- BSL/SSL lines show where liquidity was taken
- Stop below SSL sweep (for longs) or above BSL sweep (for shorts)
- Swing pivot levels for reference

TERTIARY SCRIPT: SW's AsiaLondon HL's.txt

WHY THIS SCRIPT:
- Session H/L lines show sweep target levels
- Stop beyond session extreme that was swept
- Clean level reference

DECISION RULE:
- Bullish S1: Stop below the low that was swept + buffer
- Bearish S1: Stop above the high that was swept + buffer
- Buffer: 1-2 pips (FX) or 1 ATR (indices/crypto)
- Alternative: Stop beyond the swing that caused MSS

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 11: Target Identification
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OBJECTIVE:
Set profit targets at internal structure or opposite-side external liquidity.

PRIMARY SCRIPT: ICT_Silver_Bullet_with_signals.txt  ** NEW PRIMARY **

WHY THIS SCRIPT:
- AUTO TARGET GENERATION from:
  * Pivot highs/lows (pivH, pivL arrays)
  * Weekly pivots (NWOG - Friday close, Monday open)
  * Daily pivots (NDOG - Previous day close, current day open)
- Target lines drawn automatically when FVG retrace triggers
- Minimum Trade Framework shows minimum acceptable target

SECONDARY SCRIPT: Liquidity & inducements.txt

WHY THIS SCRIPT:
- Shows untaken liquidity pools (BSL/SSL)
- Equal highs/lows as classic targets
- Updates as levels are taken
- Multiple levels for scale-out

TERTIARY SCRIPT: CandelaCharts - HTF Sweeps.txt

WHY THIS SCRIPT:
- HTF candle highs/lows as targets
- Weekly high = major BSL target
- Daily low = major SSL target
- Layered target structure

QUATERNARY SCRIPT: SW's AsiaLondon HL's.txt

WHY THIS SCRIPT:
- PDH/PDL as major targets
- Opposite session level from entry
- Session extremes as intermediate targets

OPTIONAL: Monday_Range__Lines_.txt

WHY THIS SCRIPT:
- Monday high/low as weekly liquidity targets
- Useful for mid-week trades
- Custom multipliers for extensions

DECISION RULE:
- Bullish S1: Target nearest untaken BSL, then next BSL for scale-out
- Bearish S1: Target nearest untaken SSL, then next SSL for scale-out
- Minimum 2R target before considering trade
- Scale out at intermediate levels, runner to major target

================================================================================
6. PHASE 5: OPTIONAL CONFLUENCE FILTERS
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 12: SMT Divergence Confirmation (Optional)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OBJECTIVE:
Confirm setup with divergence between correlated pairs.

PRIMARY SCRIPT: cd_sweep&cisd_Cx.txt

WHY THIS SCRIPT:
- SMT detection built-in
- Compares current symbol to correlated pair automatically
- Shows "SMT" label when divergence detected at sweep level
- Works on HTF timeframe comparison

DECISION RULE:
- SMT divergence at sweep level + in line with HTF bias = high probability
- Use as confluence only, not standalone signal
- No SMT = still valid trade if other criteria met

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 13: Displacement Quality Check (Optional)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OBJECTIVE:
Verify MSS displacement shows institutional momentum.

PRIMARY SCRIPT: Liquidity_Engulfing___Displacement__MsF_.txt

WHY THIS SCRIPT:
- Identifies candles with range > 2 standard deviations
- Optional FVG requirement confirms institutional move
- Engulfing pattern detection for body quality
- Visual highlight of displacement candles

DECISION RULE:
- Displacement candle (highlighted) during MSS = confirmed institutional momentum
- Weak MSS (small candles, no displacement) = lower probability setup
- Strong displacement + FVG = highest probability

8. MINIMUM VIABLE CHART SETUP (4 Scripts) - UPDATED
================================================================================

If you want maximum efficiency with minimum scripts:

+----+---------------------------------------------+----------------------------------+
| #  | SCRIPT                                      | COVERS STEPS                     |
+----+---------------------------------------------+----------------------------------+

+----+---------------------------------------------+----------------------------------+

TOTAL: 4 SCRIPTS cover all 11 core steps (excluding optional 12-13)

LOAD ORDER (bottom to top on TradingView):
1. SW's AsiaLondon HL's.txt — session levels
2. Liquidity & inducements.txt — swing liquidity
3. CandelaCharts - HTF Sweeps.txt — HTF context + sweeps
4. ICT_Silver_Bullet_with_signals.txt — session + MSS + FVG + signals

WHAT'S MISSING FROM MINIMUM SETUP:
- Step 2 (HTF POI) — add MirPapa or SMC for Threeple/OB zones
- Steps 12-13 (SMT, Displacement) — optional confluence

================================================================================
9. EXPANDED SETUP (7 Scripts)
================================================================================

For higher confluence and comprehensive coverage:

ALTERNATIVE ALL-IN-ONE EXECUTION BUNDLE (Optional):
- One Trading Setup for Life ICT [TradingFinder] Sweep Session FVG.txt
  - Useful if you want a single package that includes sweep + session + FVG workflow.
  - Use as an alternative tooling set for Steps 6-9, but keep the S1 sequence gates (sweep → MSS/CHOCH close → FVG).

+----+---------------------------------------------+---------------------------+

MAXIMUM SETUP (10 Scripts):
- Add Smart_Money_Concept_SMC.txt for Major/Minor OB distinction
- Add cd_sweep&cisd_Cx.txt for SMT divergence
- Add Liquidity_Engulfing.txt for displacement confirmation

================================================================================
10. CRITICAL REMINDERS
================================================================================

KEY CHANGE IN V2:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ICT_Silver_Bullet_with_signals.txt is now the RECOMMENDED PRIMARY script for
Steps 5, 7, 8, 9, and 11. It is the most complete Silver Bullet implementation
with built-in:
- Session timing (all 3 windows + pre-sessions)
- MSS detection
- FVG detection
- Entry signals (FVG Retrace alerts)
- Target generation (auto-drawn from pivots)
- Minimum Trade Framework

WHAT SCRIPTS CANNOT DO:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Even with ICT_Silver_Bullet_with_signals.txt, you must still visually confirm:

✗ Sweep occurred BEFORE MSS (script doesn't enforce sequence)
✗ FVG formed specifically DURING MSS displacement (not just anytime)
✗ Setup aligns with HTF bias (script doesn't check higher TF)

YOU MUST VISUALLY CONFIRM:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
✓ Sweep happened FIRST (use CandelaCharts for sweep detection)
✓ MSS followed AFTER sweep (script shows MSS but not sequence)
✓ FVG formed DURING MSS leg
✓ All occurred within ACTIVE killzone (script confirms this)
✓ Setup aligns with HTF bias (use Market Structure MTF)
✓ Minimum 2R reward-to-risk available (script shows minimum framework)

S1 TRADE CHECKLIST:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[ ] HTF bias determined (4H/Daily structure)
[ ] At or near HTF POI
[ ] Inside active killzone window (script confirms)
[ ] Liquidity swept (wick beyond, close back)
[ ] MSS/CHoCH confirmed (script detects)
[ ] FVG formed during MSS displacement (script detects FVG)
[ ] Entry at FVG (script signals "FVG Retrace")
[ ] Stop beyond sweep extreme
[ ] Target at opposite liquidity (script auto-generates)

NO TRADE CONDITIONS:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Outside killzone window
- No clear HTF bias
- Price not at HTF POI
- No liquidity sweep occurred
- MSS not confirmed (wick-only break)
- No FVG during displacement
- Risk-to-reward below 2R
